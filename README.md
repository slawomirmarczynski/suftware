# A fork of **SUFTware: Statistics Using Field Theory**


*SUFTware* (Statistics Using Field Theory) is Python implementation
of Bayesian field theory algorithms for low-dimensional statistical inference. It currently uses the one-dimensional density estimation algorithm DEFT.

The previous version of this software had been written by Wei-Chia Chen, Ammar Tareen and Justin B. Kinney.

This version of the Suftware library package has been created as an attempt to fix some bugs and limitation of the original.
The structure of the project was changed and streamlined, 
the deprecated time.clock() function was removed.
