class ConsumedTimeTimer:
    """
    An adapter/facade/strategy to timer functions for various Pythons.

    Since Python 3.8 the old gold time.clock() method does not work. The method
    clock() from module time had been marked as deprecated since Python 3.3.
    After the update/upgrade to Python 3.8 a call of time.clock() raises
    an AttributeError exception the message "module 'time' has no attribute
    'clock'". This make some older code forward incompatible.

    The simple solution would be replacing time.clock() deprecated method with
    time.process_time(). Nethertheless, this may lead to a backward
    incompatible code. Therefore, in order to overcome these difficulties,
    the idea was born to create ConsumedTimeTimer class as an object-oriented
    facade that encapsulate the choice of strategy for selecting
    the appropriate time-related function in the run time.

        Initialize an ConsumedTime object.

                           the actively spent time (time used by the process),
                           or also the inactivity time (i.e. wall time).

        An redefinition of the call operator. This makes using
